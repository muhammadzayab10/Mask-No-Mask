# Mask–No-Mask Detection System 😷❌
# Overview

The Mask–No-Mask Detection System is an AI-powered solution that automatically detects whether individuals are wearing face masks. Using computer vision and deep learning, it identifies faces in images or live video and classifies mask usage. This system improves public health compliance, enhances safety monitoring, and automates enforcement in workplaces, hospitals, public spaces, and transportation hubs.

# Features

Real-Time Detection: Detects faces and mask usage from live camera feeds.

Mask Classification: Accurately distinguishes “Mask” vs “No Mask” using deep learning models.

Alerts & Notifications: Sends instant alerts for non-compliance.

Data Logging & Analytics: Records violations for reporting and trend analysis.

Flexible Deployment: Can be implemented in offices, schools, hospitals, airports, and public areas.

# Technologies Used

Computer Vision: OpenCV for face detection and image preprocessing.

Deep Learning Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), MobileNet, or YOLO for face and mask classification.

Edge/Cloud Deployment: Runs on NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, or cloud servers for real-time processing.

Database & Dashboard: MySQL, MongoDB, or cloud storage to log results and monitor compliance.

# How It Works

Video/Image Capture: Cameras or images provide the input data.

Face Detection: AI models detect faces in frames using bounding boxes.

Mask Classification: Each detected face is classified as wearing a mask or not.

Alert & Logging: Non-compliance triggers alerts, and data is stored for reporting.

Analytics & Monitoring: Dashboard provides statistics on mask compliance trends.

# Advantages

Enhances public health and safety compliance.

Reduces reliance on manual monitoring and enforcement.

Provides real-time alerts for violations.

Enables data-driven insights on mask usage patterns.

# Challenges

Low-light conditions or occluded faces can reduce accuracy.

Face coverings like scarves or shields may confuse the model.

High-density environments require efficient, real-time processing.

# Applications

Hospitals and healthcare facilities.

Offices, schools, and campuses.

Airports, train stations, and public transport hubs.

Public spaces for COVID-19 or infectious disease safety enforcement.

# Future Improvements

Integrate thermal or infrared imaging for low-light detection.

Support multi-angle and partially occluded face detection.

Optimize models for mobile or edge devices to reduce latency.

Combine with crowd counting or social distancing monitoring for enhanced safety analytics.
